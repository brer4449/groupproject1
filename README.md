## General Info

Our application is designed for the single everyday horoscope reader. It gets two APIs, one from Mapquest for distance/directions and one from Aztro to get the daily horoscope. The user will first input their information via signup or login and then enter their birthday and zip code with the dropdown menus. The user will then get their daily horoscope and be prompted to continue on to see their matches. The user can then "start chatting" with their match by clicking the start chat button.
